# Solutions to Nathanson's Elementary Methods in Number Theory

Version: 0.5 \
License: GPL v3.0 \

### Usage

This manual is best used with its parent text ("Elementary Methods in Number Theory" by Melvyn B. Nathanson).  In some exercises, they may look more like hints rather than solutions themselves.

### Scope

As of now, it only contains solutions to the first three chapters. Solutions to chapter 4 is currently in preparation.

### History

This solution manual is an indirect product of my (pre) summer work at ISI (Delhi) in 2022. Indeed, I solved these problems in preparation for it. I thoroughly enjoyed solving these problems but I quickly realized typesetting them in TeX/LaTex and putting them on GitHub would add more value to them. This was how this repo came into being.

### Future

I plan to cover more chapters and add more solutions in near future.

### Bugs

There could be typos and errors. I fix them whenever I see them. Report them if you happen to find them. I would be pleased.

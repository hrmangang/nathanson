# Solutions to Nathanson's Elementary Methods in Number Theory

I am working on this repo in my free time. Please reach out to me if you notice any errors. There are a few incomplete solutions as well. I will keep adding more solutions or correcting errors.

The PDF file is [here](https://github.com/ronhuidrom/nathanson-number-theory-solutions/blob/main/NathansonSolutions.pdf).

### Usage

This manual is best used with its parent text ("Elementary Methods in Number Theory" by Melvyn B. Nathanson).  In some exercises, they may look more like hints rather than solutions themselves.

### History

This solution manual is an indirect product of my (pre) summer work at ISI (Delhi) in 2022. Indeed, I solved these problems in preparation for it. I thoroughly enjoyed solving these problems but I quickly realized typesetting them in TeX/LaTex and putting them on GitHub would add more value to them. This was how this repo came into being.

### Future

I plan to cover more chapters and add more solutions in near future.
